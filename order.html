    <p>For quotes on custom builds please complete the order form, filling in all fields and adding any additional information/requests in the comments box at the bottom. Orders are not processed and added to my build list until a 20% (non refundable) deposit has been paid.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that this process can take time as every quote is done individually and looked at in great detail. Please also be aware that market prices on things like hardware and timber etc. can fluctuate and are beyond my control. I will honor quoted prices, regardless of market prices, once a deposit has been paid.</p>
    <p>Please read my full terms of sale before submitting an order form for quoting. Submission of an order from is deemed as acceptance of all stated terms of sale.</p>
    <p>For all inquiries on concept/themed instruments please email me directly at chris@carillionguitars.com.</p>

        <h4>Guitars</h4>
        <br>
        <p>There is no set ‘standard’ on my guitars, i simply calculate what your parts and timber cost to source, then add my build fee based on what you have specified on your submitted form. I have found this the easiest way of doing things with my guitars as each one i make is basically a ‘one-off’ and so vastly different from the last. All guitars are supplied in a Hiscox hard case or (Castle cases) flight case. For any special requests on inlay work or custom designs etc. please add detailed notes (and pictures where possible) In the relevant boxes.</p>
        <p>Prices for Electrics start at approximately £2750.</p>
